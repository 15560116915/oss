# Continuous storage optimization

To maintain a storage architecture that is rational in both size and price, you must optimize your storage continuously. You must optimize your storage every month to use your storage cost more efficiently. You can simplify the optimization in the following methods:

-   Establish a mechanism to optimize your storage and configure storage policies continuously.
-   Use monitoring services and bills to monitor your storage costs.
-   Use object tags and lifecycle rules to continuously optimize your storage during the entire lifecycle of your data.

Storage optimization is a process in which you continuously evaluate the change of your data storage requirements and select the most cost-efficient storage solutions. For OSS, your can configure lifecycle rules to automatically convert data that is infrequently accessed to lower-cost storage classes. For Block Storage, you can monitor the storage usage, adjust the capacity of underused or overused cloud disks, and delete expired snapshots and disks that are not attached to ECS instances to avoid costs on storage resources that are not used. To simplify storage optimization, you can set up a monthly plan for storage optimization tasks and use the various storage management functions provided by OSS to monitor storage costs and evaluate resource usage.
