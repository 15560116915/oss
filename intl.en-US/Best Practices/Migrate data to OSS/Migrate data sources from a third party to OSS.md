# Migrate data sources from a third party to OSS {#concept_pdn_cnf_1gb .concept}

This topic describes how to use Alibaba Cloud Data Online Migration to migrate data sources from a third party to Alibaba Cloud OSS.

To use Data Online Migration, you need only to log on to the Data Transport console, specify information about the source and destination buckets, and create a migration job. After starting a migration job, you can perform management tasks for the job through the console. For example, you can view the migration progress and bandwidth throttling of the job. Additionally, you can use the console to generate a migration report to view the list of migrated files and the list of files that failed to be migrated.
