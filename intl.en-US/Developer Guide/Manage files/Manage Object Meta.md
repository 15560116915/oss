# Manage Object Meta {#concept_lkf_swy_5db .concept}

Object Meta describes the attributes of objects uploaded to OSS. These attributes are classified into two types: HTTP standard attributes \(HTTP header fields\) and User Meta \(user-defined Object Meta\). You can set Object Meta when uploading or copying objects in various ways.

-   HTTP standard attributes

    |Name|Description|
    |:---|:----------|
    |Cache-Control|The Webpage caching behavior when the object is downloaded.|
    |Content-Disposition|The name of the object during the download.|
    |Content-Encoding|The content encoding format of the object during the download.|
    |Content-Language|The content language encoding when the object is downloaded.|
    |Expires|The time the object expires.|
    |Content-Length|The size of the object.|
    |Content-Type|The type of the object.|
    |Last-Modified|The time the object is last modified.|

-   User Meta

    User Meta allows you to better describe objects. In OSS, all parameters prefixed with x-oss-meta- are considered as User Meta, such as x-oss-meta-location. An object may have multiple similar parameters, but the total size of all User Meta cannot exceed 8 KB. User Meta is returned in the HTTP header of responses to GetObject or HeadObject requests.
