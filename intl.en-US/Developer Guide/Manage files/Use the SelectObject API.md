# Use the SelectObject API {#concept_ghk_xz2_4gb .concept}

The SelectObject API is commonly used to analyze logs. It can also be used together with big data products. This topic describes how to use the Python SDK and Java SDK to call the SelectObject API in the preceding scenarios.

## Introduction {#section_jwy_bbx_b2b .section}

Object Storage Service \(OSS\) is a secure and highly reliable cloud storage service based on the Apsara system. It allows the general-purpose storage of large amounts of data on the Internet at a low cost. It also supports RESTful APIs and the auto scaling of capacity and processing capability. OSS can not only store a large number of media objects, but also serve as a data warehouse to store a large number of data objects. Currently, Hadoop 3.0 has supported OSS. You can directly read and process data in OSS when you run services such as Spark, Hive, and Presto in Amazon Elastic MapReduce \(EMR\) or use Alibaba Cloud services such as MaxCompute, HybridDB, and newly published Data Lake Analytics.

However, the current GetObject API provided by OSS only allows the big data platform to download all OSS data locally for analysis and filtering. As a result, a large number of bandwidth resources and client resources are wasted in many query scenarios.

To solve this problem, OSS provides the SelectObject API. It allows OSS, but not the big data platform, to preliminarily filter data by using conditions and projections and only return useful data to the big data platform. In this way, the client can consume fewer bandwidth resources and process less data to maximize the use of CPU and memory resources. This makes OSS-based data warehousing and data analysis a highly attractive option.

The SelectObject API is currently supported by Java and Python SDKs, and will soon be supported by SDKs in other languages. The SelectObject API supports CSV objects and JSON objects that are UTF-8 encoded. The CSV objects conform to RFC 4180, including CSV-like objects such as TSV objects. In the CSV objects, row and column delimiters and quote characters can be customized. The SelectObject API supports objects of the Standard and infrequent access \(IA\) storage classes. \(Objects of the Archive storage class must be restored before use.\) The SelectObject API also supports objects encrypted by using server-side encryption fully managed by OSS \(SSE-OSS\) or server-side encryption that uses customer master keys \(CMKs\) managed by Key Management Service \(KMS\) for encryption \(SSE-KMS\).

The SelectObject API supports JSON objects in DOCUMENT and LINES formats. A JSON DOCUMENT object contains a single object. A JSON LINES object is composed of lines of objects separated by delimiters. However, the JSON object itself may not be a valid object. The SelectObject API supports typical delimiters such as \\n and \\r\\n. You do not need to specify the delimiters.

-   Supported SQL syntax
    -   SQL statements: SELECT, FROM, and WHERE
    -   Data types: string, int64, double64, decimal128, timestamp, and Boolean
    -   Operations: logical conditions \(AND, OR, and NOT\), arithmetic expressions \(+, -, Ã—, /, and %\), comparison operations \(\>, =, <, \>=, <=, and !=\), and string operations \(LIKE and ||\)
-   Multipart query

    The SelectObject API supports multipart query that is similar to byte-based multipart download supported by the GetObject API. Data is divided into parts by row or split. Dividing data by row is commonly used but may result in unbalanced load when sparse data is divided. Dividing data by split is more efficient because the size of each split, which includes multiple rows, is roughly the same.

-   Data type

    In OSS, data in CSV objects is of the string type by default. You can use the CAST function to convert the data type. For example, the following SQL statement converts the data in the first and second columns into the integer type and compares them.

    `Select * from OSSOBject where cast (_1 as int) > cast(_2 as int)`

    In addition, the SelectObject API allows you to implicitly convert the data type in a WHERE clause. For example, the following SQL statement converts the data in the first and second columns into the integer type.

    `Select _1 from ossobject where _1 + _2 > 100`

    If you do not use the CAST function in an SQL statement, the data type of a JSON object is determined by the data type in the object. A standard JSON object can support data types such as null, Boolean, int64, double, and string.

SelectObject API in Python

-   select\_object
    -   The following example shows the sample code of the select\_object operation.

        ```
        def select_object(self, key, sql,
                           progress_callback=None,
                           select_params=None                   ):
        ```

        The preceding sample code is used to run an SQL statement on the object with the specified key and return query results.

        -   The SQL statement can be directly used as the value of the sql parameter and does not need to be Base64-encoded.
        -   The progress\_callback parameter is optional. It specifies a callback function used to report the query progress.
        -   The select\_params parameter is important for the API. It specifies the parameters and actions of the select\_object operation.
        -   You can use the headers parameter to specify the header information included in the request. The header information functions the same as that for the GetObject API. For example, you can set the bytes field in the request header to specify the range that an SQL statement can query in a CSV object.
    -   The following table describes the parameters supported by the select\_params parameter.

        |Name|Description|
        |----|-----------|
        |Json\_Type|         -   If this parameter is left empty, the object is a CSV object by default.
        -   If this parameter is set to DOCUMENT, the object is a JSON object.
        -   If this parameter is set to LINES, the object is a JSON LINES object.
 |
        |CsvHeaderInfo|The header information of the CSV object. Valid values: None, Ignore, and Use.        -   None: indicates that this object does not include header information.
        -   Ignore: indicates that this object includes header information, which is not used in the SQL statement.
        -   Use: indicates that this object includes header information, and the column names in the header information are used in the SQL statement.
|
        |CommentCharacter|The comment character in the CSV object. The parameter value can be only one character. Default value: None, indicating no comment character.|
        |RecordDelimiter|The row delimiter in the CSV object. The parameter value can be only one or two characters. Default value: \\n.|
        |OutputRecordDelimiter|The row delimiter in the output result of the select\_object operation. Default value: \\n.|
        |FieldDelimiter|The column delimiter in the CSV object. The parameter value can be only one character. Default value: comma \(,\).|
        |OutputFieldDelimiter|The column delimiter in the output result of the select\_object operation. Default value: comma \(,\).|
        |QuoteCharacter|The quote character for the columns in the CSV object. The parameter value can be only one character. Default value: double quotation marks \("\). Row and column delimiters enclosed in quotation marks are processed as normal characters.|
        |SplitRange|The split range in multipart queries. The parameter value is a closed interval in \(start, end\) format, indicating that splits from start\# to end\# are queried.|
        |LineRange|The row range in multipart queries. The parameter value is a closed interval in \(start, end\) format, indicating that rows from start\# to end\# are queried.|
        |CompressionType|The compression type. Default value: None. Valid value: GZIP.|
        |KeepAllColumns|If this parameter is set to true, columns that are excluded by the SELECT statement in the CSV object are left empty in the output result. However, the column positions are kept. Default value: false.Example:

A CSV object includes the columns firstname, lastname, and age. The SQL statement is `select firstname, age from ossobject`. If the KeepAllColumns parameter is set to true, the output result is firstname,,age, in which a comma \(,\) is added to indicate the position of the excluded lastname column. If the KeepAllColumns parameter is set to false, the output result is firstname,age. By using this parameter, you do not need to modify the code, but can directly use the code that is used to process the GetObject API to process the SelectObject API.

|
        |OutputRawData|         -   If this parameter is set to true, the select\_object operation directly returns the original data. If data is not returned for a long time, a timeout error may occur.
        -   If this parameter is set to false, the output data is encapsulated in frames. Default value: false.
 |
        |EnablePayloadCrc|Indicates whether a cyclic redundancy check \(CRC\) value is calculated for each frame. Default value: false.|
        |OutputHeader|The header information in the first line of the output result. This parameter applies only to CSV objects.|
        |SkipPartialDataRecord|         -   If this parameter is set to true, the current record is skipped when a column in a CSV object has no data or a key in a JSON object does not exist.
        -   If this parameter is set to false, a column without data is left empty in the output result.
 Example:

 A row includes the columns firstname, lastname, and age. The SQL statement is `select _1, _4 from ossobject`. If the SkipPartialDataRecord parameter is set to true, this row is skipped. If the SkipPartialDataRecord parameter is set to false, the following result is returned: firstname,\\n.

 |
        |MaxSkippedRecordsAllowed|The maximum number of skipped rows. Default value: 0, indicating that an error is returned if a row is skipped.|
        |ParseJsonNumberAsString|If this parameter is set to true, numbers in the JSON object are resolved as strings. If this parameter is set to false, numbers in the JSON object are resolved as integers or floating-point numbers. Default value: false.High-accuracy floating-point numbers in a JSON object suffer from loss of accuracy when they are resolved as floating-point numbers. To keep the accuracy, you can set this parameter to true and use the CAST function to convert the resolved data into the decimal type.

|

    -   Returned result of the select\_object operation: A SelectObjectResult object is returned. You can use the read\(\) function or the \_\_iter\_\_ method to obtain all results. If the output result contains large amounts of data, the read\(\) function is not the optimal method to obtain all results. This function may block the system until all results are returned and use excessive memory resources.

        We recommend that you use the \_\_iter\_\_ method \(foreach chunk in result\) to obtain all results and process each chunk in the results. This method uses fewer memory resources and allows the client to process each chunk immediately after it is processed by the OSS server. The client does not need to wait for all results to be returned.

-   select\_object\_to\_file

    ```
    def select_object_to_file(self, key, filename, sql,
                       progress_callback=None,
                       select_params=None
                       ):
    ```

    The preceding sample code is used to run an SQL statement on the object with the specified key and write the query results to another specified object.

    Other parameters are the same as those of the [select\_object](#ul_unq_lgf_4gb) operation.

-   create\_select\_object\_meta
    -   The following sample code shows the syntax of the select\_meta\_params parameter.

        ```
        def create_select_object_meta(self, key, select_meta_params=None):
        ```

        The preceding sample code is used to create Select Meta for the object with the specified key or obtain Select Meta from such an object. Select Meta includes the total number of rows, total number of columns \(for CSV objects\), and total number of splits in an object.

        If Select Meta has been created for an object, this function does not re-create Select Meta unless the value of the OverwriteIfExists parameter is set to true.

        To create Select Meta for an object, the object must be completely scanned.

    -   The following table describes the parameters supported by the select\_meta\_params parameter.

        |Name|Description|
        |----|-----------|
        |Json\_Type|If this parameter is left empty, the object is a CSV object by default. If this parameter is specified, the parameter value must be LINES, indicating that the object is a JSON LINES object. This operation does not apply to JSON DOCUMENT objects.|
        |RecordDelimiter|The row delimiter in the CSV object.|
        |FieldDelimiter|The column delimiter in the CSV object.|
        |QuoteCharacter|The quote character in the CSV object. Row and column delimiters enclosed in quotation marks are processed as normal characters.|
        |CompressionType|The compression type. If this parameter is specified, the parameter value must be None.|
        |OverwriteIfExists|Indicates whether the created Select Meta overwrites the original Select Meta. You do not need to set this parameter in common scenarios.|

    -   Returned result of the create\_select\_object\_meta operation: A GetSelectObjectMetaResult object is returned, which includes the rows and splits attributes. For a CSV object, the select\_resp object in the result includes the columns attribute, indicating the number of columns in the CSV object.

-   SQL statement examples for JSON objects

    The following JSON object is used as an example.

    ```
    {
      "contacts":[
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "isAlive": true,
      "age": 27,
      "address": {
        "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "postalCode": "10021-3100"
      },
      "phoneNumbers": [
        {
          "type": "home",
          "number": "212 555-1234"
        },
        {
          "type": "office",
          "number": "646 555-4567"
        },
        {
          "type": "mobile",
          "number": "123 456-7890"
        }
      ],
      "children": [],
      "spouse": null
    }, ... # Other similar nodes are omitted.
    ]}
    ```

    The following table describes the SQL statement examples.

    |Scenario|SQL statement|
    |--------|-------------|
    |Returns all records in which the value of age is 27.| select \* from ossobject.contacts\[\*\] s where s.age = 27

 |
    |Returns all home phone numbers.| select s.number from ossobject.contacts\[\*\].phoneNumbers\[\*\] s where s.type = "home"

 |
    |Returns all records in which the value of spouse is null.| select \* from ossobject s where s.spouse is null

 |
    |Returns all records in which the value of children is left empty.|select \* from ossobject s where s.children\[0\] is null**Note:** The preceding statement is used because an empty array cannot be specified in other ways.

## Best practices {#section_vk1_hky_b2b .section}

-   Query large objects in multipart queries.

    If columns in a CSV object do not include row delimiters, you can divide the object into parts based on bytes. This method is the simplest because you do not need to create Select Meta for the object. If columns in a CSV object include row delimiters or a JSON object is queried, follow these steps:

    1.  Call the create\_select\_object\_meta operation to obtain the total number of splits for the object. If you need to call the SelectObject API for the object, call it asynchronously before the query to shorten the scanning time.
    2.  Select the appropriate concurrency n based on resources on the client, and divide the total number of splits by the concurrency n to get the number of splits to be contained in each query.
    3.  Set parameters, such as split-range=1-20, in the request body to perform multipart queries.
    4.  Merge the results if required.
-   Use the SelectObject API for normal objects. We recommend that you do not use the SelectObject API to query multipart and appendable objects. The differences in their internal structures may deteriorate the query performance.
-   When querying a JSON object, narrow down the JSON path range in the FROM statement.

    \[DO NOT TRANSLATE\]

    The following JSON object is used as an example.

    ```
    { contacts:[
            {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Smith", "phoneNumbers":[{"type":"home", "number":"212-555-1234"}, {"type":"office", "number":"646-555-4567"}, {"type":"mobile", "number":"123 456-7890"}], "address":{"streetAddress": "21 2nd Street", "city":"New York", "state":NY, "postalCode":"10021-3100"}
             }
    ]}
    ```

    To query all streetAddress data of records in which postalCode starts with 10021, run the following SQL statement:

    `select s.address.streetAddress from ossobject.contacts[*] s where s.address.postalCode like â€˜10021%â€™`

    Alternatively, run the following SQL statement:

    `select s.streetAddress from ossobject.contacts[*].address s where s.postalCode like â€˜10021%â€™`

    The query performance of the second SQL statement is better because the JSON path is more accurate.

-   Process high-accuracy floating-point numbers in JSON objects.

    If you need to calculate high-accuracy floating-point numbers in a JSON object, we recommend that you set the ParseJsonNumberAsString parameter to true, and use the CAST function to convert the resolved data into the decimal type. For example, the value of attribute a is 123456789.123456789. You can run `select s.a from ossobject s where cast(s.a as decimal) > 123456789.12345` to maintain the accuracy of attribute a.
