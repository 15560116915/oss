# Query the region information of a bucket

You can use the GetBucketLocation operation of OSS to query the location information about the region, which is the data center, where a bucket is located.

**Note:** For more information about the GetBucketLocation operation, see [GetBucketLocation](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Bucket operations/Basic operations/GetBucketLocation.md).

The returned Location field indicates the region where the bucket is located. For example, a bucket is located in the China \(Hangzhou\) region, and the value of the returned Location field is `oss-cn-hangzhou`. For more information about regions, see [Regions and endpoints](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Endpoint/Regions and endpoints.md).
