# Delete a bucket {#concept_xst_dbb_5db .concept}

You can use the DeleteBucket API of OSS to delete a bucket that you create.

**Note:** For more information about the DeleteBucket API, see [DeleteBucket](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Bucket operations/DeleteBucket.md#).

Before deleting a bucket, you must delete all objects or object parts generated by incomplete multipart upload in the bucket. To delete all objects in a bucket, we recommend that you [manage object lifecycle](reseller.en-US//Manage lifecycle rules.md#).
