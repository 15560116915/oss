# Rounded rectangle

This topic describes the parameters and examples to crop an image in rounded rectangle.

## Precautions

-   If the final format of the image is PNG, WebP, or BMP that supports alpha channels, the areas of the image outside the rounded rectangle become transparent. If the final format of the image is JPG, the areas of the image outside the rounded rectangle become white. We recommend that you save the processed image in PNG.
-   If the specified radius is greater than the radius of the largest incircle of the source image, the largest incircle still applies for cropping.
