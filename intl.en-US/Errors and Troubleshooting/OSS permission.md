## OSS errors 403 {#section_llv_4s3_wdb .section}

An OSS error 403 indicates that the HTTP status code returned from OSS is 403 and that the server receives your request but rejects to provide service because you have no access permission. OSS errors 403 and causes are listed in the following table:

|Error|Message|Cause|Solution|

Among them, the permissions issue is part of the 403 error. The error with the permission problem is `AccessDenied`. These errors are described in detail below.

## Common permissions errors {#section_ttw_rs3_wdb .section}

The privilege issue is that the current user does not have permission to specify an action. The errors returned by OSS and their causes can be found in the following table:

|SN|Error|Cause|
|:-|:----|:----|
|1|ErrorCode: AccessDeniedErrorMessage: The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint. Please send all future requests to this endpoint.|The bucket does not match the endpoint.|
|2|ErrorCode: AccessDeniedErrorMessage: You are forbidden to list buckets.|You have no permissions for listBuckets.|
|3|ErrorCode: AccessDeniedErrorMessage: You do not have write acl permission on this object|You have no permissions for setObjectAcl.|
|4|ErrorCode: AccessDeniedErrorMessage: You do not have read acl permission on this object.|You have no permissions for getObjectAcl.|
|5|ErrorCode: AccessDeniedErrorMessage: The bucket you access does not belong to you.|The subaccount has no permissions for bucket management like getBucketAcl, CreateBucket, deleteBucket, setBucketReferer, and getBucketReferer.|
|6|ErrorCode: AccessDeniedErrorMessage: You have no right to access this object because of bucket acl.|The subaccount/temporary account has no permissions to access the object like putObject getObject, appendObject, deleteObject, and postObject.|
|7|ErrorCode: AccessDeniedErrorMessage: Access denied by authorizer’s policy.|The temporary account has no access permissions. The authorization policy specified for assuming the role of this temporary account has no permissions.|
|8|ErrorCode: AccessDeniedErrorMessage: You have no right to access this object.|The subaccount/temporary account has no permissions for the current operation like initiateMultipartUpload.|

## Permission error troubleshooting {#section_usf_5s3_wdb .section}

Check whether the key is for the primary user, the subaccount or the temporary account.

-   Check whether the key is for a primary user.

    Log on to the [console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ak) to check whether the AccessKeyID exists. If it does exist, the key is for a primary user.

-   Check the subaccount permission, that is, the authorization policy.

    Check the subaccount AccessKeyID and find out the corresponding subaccount by navigation to**Resource Access Management** \> **User Management** \> **Management** \> **User Details** \> **User AccessKey**.

    Log on to the console and navigate to**Resource Access Management** \> **User Management** \> **Management** \> **User Authorization Policy** \> **Individual Authorization Policy/User Authorization Policy**to check the permissions.

-   Check the permissions for a temporary account.

    The AccessKeyID for the temporary account can be recognized easily since it starts with “STS”, for example, “STS.MpsSonrqGM8bGjR6CRKNMoHXe”.  Log on to the console and navigate to**Resource Access Management ** \> **Role Management** \> **Management** \> **Role Authorization Policy** \> **View Permissions**to check the permissions.


The access rights error process is shown in the following figure:

Procedures for checking the permissions:

1.  List the required permissions and resources.
2.  Check whether Action has the required operation.
3.  Check whether Resource is the required operation object.
4.  Check whether Effect is “Allow” instead of “Deny”.
5.  Check whether Condition is set correctly.

If it is unable to detect the error through checking, the following adjustments are required:

1.  The condition, if any, must be removed.
2.  Remove “Deny” in Effect.
3.  Change Resource to “Resource”: “\*”.
4.  Change Action to “Action”: “oss:\*”.
