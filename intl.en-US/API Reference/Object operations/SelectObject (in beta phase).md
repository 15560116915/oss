# SelectObject \(in beta phase\) {#reference_lz1_r1x_b2b .reference}

## Introduction {#section_jwy_bbx_b2b .section}

Object Storage Service \(OSS\) built on Alibaba Cloud’s Apsara distributed system is a massive, secure, and highly reliable cloud storage solution that offers low cost storage accessible anywhere in the world. OSS possesses excellent scaling abilities for storage capacity and processes, and supports RESTful APIs.  Not only can OSS store media files, but it can also be utilized as a data warehouse for massive data file storage. OSS can seamlessly integrate with Hadoop 3.0, and services that are run on EMR \(such as Spark/Hive/Presto, MaxCompute, HybridDB and the newly-released Data Lake Analytics\) support data processing and retrieval directly from OSS.

However, the current GetObject interface provided by OSS determines that the big data platform can only download all OSS data locally and then for analysis and filter. A lot of bandwidth and client resources are wasted in querying scenarios.

To address this problem, the SelectObject interface is provided. This method allows big data platforms to access OSS to perform basic filtering on data through conditions and Projection, and return useful data only to the big data platform. In this way, the bandwidth and the amount of data processed at the client-side is greatly reduced, making OSS-based data warehousing and data analysis a highly attractive option.

SelectObject is now in beta phase, and provides Java and Python SDKs. SelectObject supports CSV files of RFC 4180 standard to be encoded as UTF-8 \(including Class CSV files such as TSV, row and column separators of the file and customizable Quote characters\). SelectObject supports files in standard and low frequency access storage types, and encrypted files, which are fully managed by OSS \(or CMK managed by KMS\).

The supported SQL syntax is as follows:

-   SQL statements: Select From Where
-   Data Type: String, Int \(64bit\), float \(64bit\), Timestamp, and Boolean
-   Operation: Logical condition \(AND, OR, NOT\), Arithmetic Expression \(+-\*/%\), Comparison operation \(\>,=, <, \>=, <=, ! =\), and String operation \(LIKE, || \)

The sharding mechanism of SelectObject is similar to the shard download mechanism of GetObject, and includes two sharding methods: sharding by row and sharding by Split. Sharding by row is a common method, but it results in uneven load balancing of sparse data. Sharding by Split is more efficient than sharding by row as a Split contains multiple rows of data, and the data size of each Split is roughly equal, which enables better load balancing performance. Additionally, byte-based sharding \(provided by GetObject\) may corrupt data. Therefore, sharding by Split is recommended for CSV data.

CSV data in OSS is String type by default. Users can use CAST function to convert data. For example, the following SQL query converts \_1 and \_2 into Int and compares them.

`Select * from OSSOBject where cast (_1 as int) > cast(_2 as int)`

Furthermore, SelectObject supports implicit conversion in WHERE condition, such as the first and the second columns in the following statement will be converted to Int:

`Select _1 from ossobject where _1 + _2 > 100`

## Description of RESTful API {#section_tp1_zcx_b2b .section}

Execute the SQL statement on the target CSV files and the execution results will be returned. At the same time, the command will automatically save the metadata information of the CSV files, such as the total number of rows and columns.

The API returns a 206 response when the SQL statement is executed correctly. If the SQL statement is incorrect or does not match the CSV files, a 400 error response will be returned.

Take the following statement as example:

 `select _5, _1 from ossobject.`

 If the value of KeepAllColumn is true, with six columns of data in total, the returned data is as follows:

 Value of 1st column ...Value of 5th column,\\n

 Child node: None

 Parent node: CSV\(output\)

 |

**Response results**

The request results are returned as a Frame. The format of each frame is as follows, where checksum is CRC32:

Frame-Type | Payload Length | Header Checksum | Payload | Payload Checksum

<---4 bytes--\><---4 bytes----------\><-------4 bytes-------\><variable\><----4bytes----------\>

There are three different frame types, which are as follows:

|Name|Frame-Type Value|Payload format|Description|
|:---|:---------------|:-------------|:----------|
|Data Frame| version | 8388609

 <--1 byte\><--3 bytes\>

 | scanned size  |  data

 <-8 bytes----------\><---variable-\>

 The scanned size is the size of the scanned data, and the data is the data returned from the query.

 |Data Frame is used to return the query data and report its current progress at the same time.|
|Continuous Frame| version  | 8388612

 <--1 byte\><--3 bytes-\>

 | scanned size

 <----8 bytes--\>

 |Continuous Frame is used to report current progress and maintain HTTP connections. If the query does not return data within 5s,  a Continuous Frame will be returned. |
|End Frame| version  | 8388613

 | Offset  | total scanned bytes | http status code | error message

 <--8bytes-\><--8bytes--------------\><----4 bytes--------\><-variable------\>

 Where offset is the final location offset after scanning and total scanned bytes is the total bytes of all scanned data. http status code is the final processing result. and error message is the error message itself.

 |The reason it returns the status code is that when the SelectObject is streamed, only the first block is processed when the Response Header is sent. If the first block of data and SQL match, the Status in the Response Header is a 206 response, but if the following data is illegal, the Status in the Header cannot be changed, and the final Status and Error message includes only the End Frame. Therefore, the client should treat it as the final result.|

**SQL statement regex**

`SELECT select-list from OSSObject where_opt limit_opt`

The keywords SELECT, OSSOBJECT and WHERE cannot be changed.

```
select_list: column name

| column index (for example, _1, _2)

| function(column index | column name)

| select_list AS alias
```

The supported functions are AVG, SUM, MAX, MIN, COUNT, and CAST \(type conversion function\). Only \* can be used after COUNT.

```
Where_opt:
| WHERE expr
expr:
| literal value
| column name
| column index
| expr op expr
| expr OR expr
| expr AND expr
| expr IS NULL
| expr IS NOT NULL
| expr IN (value1, value2,….)
| expr NOT in (value1, value2,…)
| expr between value1 and value2
| NOT (expr)
| expr op expr
| (expr)
| cast (column index or column name or literal as INT|DOUBLE|DATETIME)
```

op: includes \> < \>= <= ! = =, LIKE, +-\*/%, and connection string ||.

cast: Cast can only be one type for the same column.

`limit_opt:`

| limit Integer

Mixing of aggregations and limit

`Select avg(cast(_1 as int)) from ossobject limit 100`

In the preceding statement, the AVG value of the first column in the first 100 rows is calculated. This statement is different from what MYSQL outputs, as aggregation in SelectObject always returns only one row of data, so there is no need to limit its output volumes. Therefore, the limit in SelectObject will be executed before the Aggregate function.

SQL statement restrictions are as follows:

-   Only UTF-8 encoded text files are supported. Uncompressed GZIP text files can be processed. Support for processing compressed files is coming soon.
-   Only single file queries are supported, not JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING
-    Not contains aggregation conditions in WHERE statement. For example, where max\(cast\(age as int\)\) \> 100 is not allowed.
-   Up to 1000 columns are supported and the maximum column name is 1024.
-   Up to 5% wildcards are supported in the LIKE statement. \* and % are equivalent, representing 0 or multiple arbitrary characters.
-   Up to 1024 constant items are supported in the IN statement.
-   The Projection after Select can be a column name, a column index \(\_1, \_2, etc.\), an aggregate function, or a CAST function. Other expressions are not supported Like select \_ 1 + \_2 from ossobject is not allowed.
-   The length of maximum row and column are both 256 KB.

## CreateSelectObjectMeta {#section_pbq_vfy_b2b .section}

CreateSelectObjectMeta API is used to obtain information about the target CSV file, such as the total number of rows, the total number of columns, and the number of Splits. If the information does not exist in the file, the whole CSV file is scanned for the preceding information. If the API executes correctly, a 200 response is returned. If the target CSV file is illegal or the specified delimiter does not match the target CSV file, a 400 error response is returned.

## Best practices {#section_vk1_hky_b2b .section}

If you want to perform Shard-Query on a massive file, we recommend that you:

1.  Call the Create Select Object Meta API to get the total number of Splits for the file. If the file needs to call the SelectObject API, this API makes asynchronous calls before the query, which reduces scan time.
2.  Select the appropriate concurrency n based on client-side resources, and divide the total number of Splits by the concurrency n to get the number of Splits that each shard query should contain.
3.  Perform the Shard-Query in a form of split-range=1-20 in request body.
4.  Merge the results if required.

Use SelectObject with Normal type files. Files of Multipart and Appendable types are not recommended due to poor performance caused by differences in their internal structure.
