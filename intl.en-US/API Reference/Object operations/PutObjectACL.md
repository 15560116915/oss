# PutObjectACL {#reference_fs3_gfw_wdb .reference}

Modifies the ACL for an object. Only the bucket owner who has the write permission on the requested object can perform PutObjectACL operations.

**Note:** 

-   The object ACL takes precedence over the bucket ACL. For example, if the bucket ACL is private and the object ACL is public-read-write, OSS first checks the ACL for the object when a user accesses the object. As a result, all users can access this object even if the ACL for the bucket is a private. If the ACL for an object has never been set, the ACL for this object is same as that for the bucket where the object is located.
-   Read operations to an object include: the read operations to the source object in GetObject, HeadObject, CopyObject, and UploadPartCopy Write operations to an object include: the write operations on a new object in PutObject, PostObject, AppendObject, DeleteObject, DeleteMultipleObjects, CompleteMultipartUpload, and CopyObject.
-   You can also include the x-oss-object-acl header in the request to set the ACL for an object when performing write operations on the object. For example, if you include the x-oss-object-acl header in the PutObject request, you can set the ACL for the object while uploading it.

## ACL overview {#section_bg5_wfw_wdb .section}

You can specify the x-oss-object-acl header in the PutObjectACL request.to set the ACL for an object. The following table describes the four ACLs that can be set for an object.

|ACL|Description|
|:--|:----------|
|private|This ACL indicates that an object is a private resource. Only the owner of this object has the permission to read or write this object.|
|public-read|This ACL indicates that an object is a resource that can be read by the public. Only the owner of this object Â has the permission to read and write this object. Other users only have the permission to read this object.|
|public-read-write|This ACL indicates that an object is a resource that can be read and written by the public. All users have the permission to read and write this object.|
|default|This ACL indicates an object is a resource inheriting the read-write permissions of the bucket. That is, the bucket and the object have the same permissions.|
