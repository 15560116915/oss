# DeleteMultipleObjects {#reference_ydg_25v_wdb .reference}

Deletes multiple objects from the same bucket.

You can perform the DeleteMultipleObjects operation to delete up to 1,000 objects with one request. Two response modes are available: the Verbose mode and the Quiet mode.

-   Verbose mode: The message body returned by OSS contains the result of each deleted object.
-   Quiet mode: The message body returned by OSS only contains the results for objects which encountered an error in the DELETE process. If all objects are successfully deleted, no message body is returned.

## Request syntax {#section_iqs_fvv_wdb .section}

  </Object>

</Delete>
```

## Request headers {#section_wmb_lvv_wdb .section}

OSS verifies the received message body based on the following headers, and deletes the object only when the attributes of the message body conform to the headers.

|Name|Description|
|:---|:----------|
|encoding-type|Specify the encoding type of the Key in the returned result. Currently, the URL encoding is supported. The Key adopts UTF-8 encoding, but the XML 1.0 Standard does not support parsing certain control characters, such as the characters with ASCII values from 0 to 10. In case that the Key contains control characters not supported by the XML 1.0 Standard, you can specify the encoding-type to encode the returned Key.Data type: String

Default: None

Optional value: url

|

|Header|Type|Required|Description|
|:-----|:---|:-------|:----------|
|Encoding-type|String|No| The Key parameter is UTF-8 encoded. If the Key parameter includes control characters which are not supported by the XML 1.0 standard, you can specify this header to encode the Key parameter in the returned result.

 Default value: None

 Valid value: url

 |
|Content-Length|String|Yes| Indicates the length of the HTTP message body.

 OSS verifies the received message body based on this header, and deletes the object only when the length of the message body is the same as this header.

 |
|Content-MD5|String|Yes| Content-MD5 is a string calculated with the MD5 algorithm. This header is used to check whether the content of the received message is consistent with that of the sent message. If this header is included in the request, OSS calculates the Content-MD5 of the received message body and compares it with the value of this header.

 **Note:** To obtain the value of this header, encrypt the message body of the DeleteMultipleObjects request using the MD5 algorithm to get a 128-bit byte array, and then base64-encode the byte array.
