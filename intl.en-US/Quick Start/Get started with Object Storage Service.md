# Get started with Object Storage Service {#concept_ptc_g24_tdb .concept}

Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service \(OSS\) provides you with network-based data access services. OSS allows you to store and retrieve a variety of unstructured data files, including text files, images, audio files, and video files, over the network at any time.

Before you use OSS, we recommend that you familiarize with OSS usage limits. For more information, see [Limits](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md#).

OSS uploads data files as objects to a bucket. You can perform the following operations in OSS:

-   Create one or multiple buckets and upload one or multiple objects to each bucket.
-   Share or download an object by using its URL assigned by OSS.
-   Configure the ACL for a bucket or object by modifying its attributes or metadata.
-   Perform basic and advanced OSS operations in the OSS console or by using various convenient tools and SDKs.

## Use the OSS console {#section_pw1_4dp_yfb .section}

The following figure shows the steps to perform basic OSS operations in the OSS console.

Watch the following video to learn how to upload and download objects from the OSS console.  

## Use ossbrowser {#section_iby_x2p_yfb .section}

ossbrowser is a graphical object management tool for OSS. This tool supports the Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems. You can use ossbrowser to view, upload, and download objects and folders, upload or download objects in resumable mode, or perform GUI-based policy authorization. As a desktop graphical tool, ossbrowser provides lower transmission speed and performance than ossutil. For more information, see [Quick start](../../../../intl.en-US/Tools/ossbrowser/Quick start.md#).

## Use ossutil {#section_lfg_cfp_yfb .section}

ossutil allows you to use command lines to manage OSS data and supports the following operating systems: Windows, Linux, and Mac. ossutil provides simple commands to efficiently manage buckets and objects and supports concurrent upload tasks. ossutil supports the upload, download, and resumable transmission of objects and folders. For more information, see [Quick start](../../../../intl.en-US/Tools/ossutil/Quick start.md#).

## Use APIs and SDKs {#section_ud2_qxp_yfb .section}

OSS provides APIs and SDKs in multiple programming languages to facilitate secondary development. For more information, see the following links:

-   [Java SDK quick start](../../../../intl.en-US/SDK Reference/Java/Quick start.md#)
-   [Python SDK quick start](../../../../intl.en-US/SDK Reference/Python/Quick start.md#)
-   [PHP SDK quick start](../../../../intl.en-US/SDK Reference/PHP/Quick start.md#)
-   [Go SDK quick start](../../../../intl.en-US/SDK Reference/Go/Quick start.md#)
-   [C SDK quick start](../../../../intl.en-US/SDK Reference/C/Quick start.md#)

For SDK examples in more programming languages, see [OSS SDK introduction](../../../../intl.en-US/SDK Reference/Introduction.md#). For more information about OSS APIs, see [OSS API introduction](../../../../intl.en-US/API Reference/Overview.md#).

## Subsequent operations {#section_l45_hlq_yfb .section}
