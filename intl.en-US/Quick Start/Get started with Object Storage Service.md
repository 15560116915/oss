# Get started with Object Storage Service {#concept_ptc_g24_tdb .concept}

Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service \(OSS\)Â is a network-based data storage service. Using OSS, you can store and retrieve a variety of unstructured data files over the network at any time, including text files, images, audios, and videos.

OSS uploads data as objects to a bucket. You can do the following:

-   Create one or multiple buckets. Add one or multiple objects to each bucket.
-   Share or download an object by getting its URL assigned by OSS.
-   Set access permissions of a bucket or object by modifying its attributes.
-   Perform basic and advanced tasks in the OSS console.
-   Perform basic and advanced tasks by using the development toolkit or calling the RESTful API in an application program.

Before you use OSS, we recommend that you get familiar with [OSS service limits](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md#). This guide describes how to complete the basic tasks shown in the following figure in the OSS console.
