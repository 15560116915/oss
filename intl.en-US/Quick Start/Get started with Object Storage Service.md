# Get started with Object Storage Service {#concept_ptc_g24_tdb .concept}

Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service \(OSS\) provides you with network-based data access services. Using OSS, you can store and retrieve a variety of unstructured data files, including text files, images, audio files, and video files, over the network at any time.

Before you use OSS, we recommend that you get familiar with [OSS service limits](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md#).

OSS uploads data as objects to a bucket. You can perform the following operations in OSS:

-   Create one or multiple buckets and upload one or multiple objects to each bucket.
-   Share or download an object by using its URL assigned by OSS.
-   Set the ACL for a bucket or an object by modifying its attributes or metadata.
-   Perform basic and advanced OSS operations in the OSS console or by using various convenient tools and SDKs.

## Perform OSS operations in the OSS console {#section_pw1_4dp_yfb .section}

The following figure shows the steps to perform basic OSS operations in the OSS console.

## Use ossbrowser {#section_iby_x2p_yfb .section}

Ossbrowser is a graphical data management tool for OSS, which supports Windows, Linux, and Mac. Using ossbrowser, you can view, upload, and download objects and folders \(directories\), upload or download objects in resumable mode, or authorize policies in the graphical interface. As a desktop graphical tool, the transmission speed and performance of ossbrowder is not as good as ossutil. For more information, see [Quick start](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Tools/ossbrowser/Quick start.md#).

## Use ossutil {#section_lfg_cfp_yfb .section}

Ossutil is a data management tool for OSS based on command lines, which supports Windows, Linux, and Mac. Ossutil provides good operation performance by using convenient, simple and various commands for object management and supports concurrent upload tasks. Ossutil supports the upload, download, and resumable transmission of objects and folders \(directories\). For more information, see [Quick start](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Tools/ossutil/Quick Start.md#).

## Use OSS API/SDK {#section_ud2_qxp_yfb .section}

OSS provides APIs/SDKs in multiple languages, allowing you to perform secondary development quickly. For more information about OSS API/SDK, see:

-   [Java SDK](../../../../../reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/Java/Quick start.md#)
-   [Python SDK](../../../../../reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/Python/Quick start.md#)
-   [PHP SDK](../../../../../reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/PHP/Quick start.md#)
-   [Go SDK](../../../../../reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/Go/Quick start.md#)
-   [C SDK](../../../../../reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/C/Quick start.md#)

For SDK examples in more languages, see [OSS SDK Introduction](../../../../../reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/Introduction.md#). For more information about OSS APIs, see [OSS API Introduction](../../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/OSS API documentation overview.md#).
