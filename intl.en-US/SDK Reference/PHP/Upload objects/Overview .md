In OSS, an object is the basic unit for data operations. OSS PHP SDK provides the following file upload methods:

-    [Simple upload](reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/PHP/Upload objects/Simple upload.md#): supports the upload of a file up to 5 GB in size.
-    [Append upload](reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/PHP/Upload objects/Append upload.md#): supports the upload of a file up to 5 GB in size.
-    [Multipart upload](reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/PHP/Upload objects/Multipart upload.md#): supports the upload of a file up to 48.8 TB in size. It applies to the upload of large files

**Note:** For more information about the usage scenarios of each upload method, see “Upload files” in OSS Developer Guide. After you complete the file upload, you can perform [upload callback](reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/PHP/Upload objects/Upload callback.md#).
