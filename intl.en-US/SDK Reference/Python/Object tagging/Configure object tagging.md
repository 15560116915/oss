# Configure object tagging {#concept_644876 .concept}

This topic describes how to configure object tagging.

The object tagging function uses a key-value pair to tag an object. For more information about the object tagging function, see [Object tagging](../../../../intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Objects/Manage files/Object tagging.md#).

**Note:** 

-   You can add tags to an object when uploading it or add tags for an uploaded object. If add tags to an object that already has tags, the original tags are overwritten. For more information about adding tags, see [PutObjectTagging](../../../../intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/PutObjectTagging.md#).
-   To add tags to an object, you must have the permission to call PutObjectTagging.
-   The Last-Modified value of an object is not updated when its tags are changed.
-   A tag can contain letters, numbers, spaces, and the following symbols: + â€‘ = . \_ : /

## Add tags to an object when uploading it {#section_chb_rrt_z4g .section}

-   Add tags to an object when uploading it by calling put\_object.

    Run the following code to add tags to an object when uploading it by calling put\_object:

    ``` {#codeblock_tg8_afo_7ox}
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    
    import oss2
    from oss2.headers import OSS_OBJECT_TAGGING
    
    # It is highly risky to log on with the AccessKey of an Alibaba Cloud account because the account has permissions on all the APIs in OSS. We recommend that you log on as a RAM user to access APIs or perform routine operations and maintenance. To create a RAM user account, log on to https://ram.console.aliyun.com.
    auth = oss2.Auth('<yourAccessKeyId>', '<yourAccessKeySecret>')
    # This example uses the China East 1 (Hangzhou) endpoint. Specify an actual endpoint based on your requirements.
    bucket = oss2.Bucket(auth, 'http://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com', '<yourBucketName>')
    
    object_name = '<yourObjectName>'
    
    # Configures the tags in the HTTP headers.
    headers = dict()
    headers[OSS_OBJECT_TAGGING] = "k1=v1&k2=v2&k3=v3"
    
    # Set the headers of put_object so that the tags are added to the object to be uploaded. 
    result = bucket.put_object(object_name, 'content', headers=headers)
    print('http response status: ', result.status)
    
    # View the tags added to the uploaded object.
    result = bucket.get_object_tagging('yourObjectName')
    for key in result.tag_set.tagging_rule:
        print('tagging key: {}, value: {}'.format(key, result.tag_set.tagging_rule[key]))
    ```

-   Add tags to an object when uploading it by calling multipart\_upload.

    Run the following code to add tags to an object when uploading it by calling multipart\_upload:

    ``` {#codeblock_zco_we3_nqx}

    # Configures the tags in the HTTP headers.
    headers = dict()
    headers[OSS_OBJECT_TAGGING] = 'k1=v1&k2=v2'

    with open(filename, 'rb') as fileobj:
        part_number = 1
        offset = 0
        while offset < total_size:
            num_to_upload = min(part_size, total_size - offset)
        # SizedFileAdapter(fileobj, size) generates a new file object and recalculates the position where the next upload task starts.
            result = bucket.upload_part(object_name, upload_id, part_number,
                                        SizedFileAdapter(fileobj, num_to_upload))
            parts.append(PartInfo(part_number, result.etag))
    
            offset += num_to_upload
            part_number += 1
    
    # Completes the multipart upload task.
    result = bucket.complete_multipart_upload(object_name, upload_id, parts)
    print('http response status: ', result.status)
    
    # Views the tags added to the object.
    result = bucket.get_object_tagging(object_name)
    for key in result.tag_set.tagging_rule:

    with open(filename, 'rb') as fileobj:
        assert bucket.get_object(object_name).read() == fileobj.read()
    ```

## Add tags to an object when copying it {#section_v75_lzs_v7a .section}

You can specify one of the following tagging rules when copying an object:

-   Copy \(default\): Copy the tags of the source object to the destination object.
-   Replace: Add the tags specified in the request to the destination object.

Examples of adding tags to objects of different sizes when copying them are described as follows:

-   Run the following code to add tags to an object smaller than 1 GB when directly copying it:

``` {#codeblock_il7_vw1_87y}

# Views the tags added to the objet src_object_name.
result = bucket.get_object_tagging(src_object_name)
for key in result.tag_set.tagging_rule:
    print('src tagging key: {}, value: {}'.format(key, result.tag_set.tagging_rule[key]))
