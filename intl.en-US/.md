# Release notes

This topic describes the release notes of OSS features.

|Feature change|Feature|Released on|Supported region|Documentation|
|--------------|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
|Cross-region replication \(CRR\) rules based on object tags|You can configure CRR rules based on object tags only when versioning is enabled for both the source and destination buckets and **Add/Change** is selected for **Operations**. After you configure CRR rules based on object tags,, OSS synchronizes the objects with the specified tags to the destination bucket.|2020-08-28|All regions except UAE \(Dubai\) and Japan \(Tokyo\)|[Configure CRR](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Redundancy for fault tolerance/Configure CRR.md)|
|Transfer acceleration in CRR|You can use transfer acceleration to accelerate data transfer when you replicate data across regions.|2020-08-28|CRR from Australia \(Sydney\) to China \(Beijing\)|[Configure CRR](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Redundancy for fault tolerance/Configure CRR.md)|
|Accelerate endpoints outside mainland China in transfer acceleration|Accelerate endpoints outside mainland China are supported in transfer acceleration. If you want to enable transfer acceleration for a bucket outside mainland China by using a custom domain name that is not filed at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\), you must map the custom domain name to an accelerate endpoint outside mainland China.|2020-07-28|All regions outside mainland China|[Bind accelerate endpoints](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Manage a domain/Bind accelerate endpoints.md)|
|Recovery and bulk deletion of previous versions in the OSS console|After you enable versioning for a bucket, you can recover specified previous versions of an object and delete object previous versions in batches in the OSS console.|2020-07-24|All regions|[Versioning](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Redundancy for fault tolerance/Versioning.md)|
|Forward slash retention in origin URL in mirroring back-to-origin|If the name of the requested object in the origin starts with a forward slash \(/\), the forward slash is kept in the origin URL of the object.|2020-07-20|US \(Silicon Valley\), US \(Virginia\), and China \(Hangzhou\)|[Configure back-to-origin rules](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Basic settings/Configure back-to-origin rules.md)|
|Auto CDN cache update for specified operations|You can specify operations that trigger auto CDN cache update. When the specified operations, such as PutObject and DeleteObject, are performed on objects, the CDN cache is automatically updated.|2020-06-05|All regions|[Bind accelerated domain names](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Manage a domain/Bind accelerated domain names.md)|
|MD5 verification and object prefix replacement in mirroring back-to-origin|-   MD5 verification: When the response contains the Content-MD5 header, OSS checks whether the MD5 hash of the returned object matches the value of Content-MD5. If the MD5 hash matches the value of Content-MD5, the object is stored in OSS. Otherwise, the object is not stored.
-   Replace or delete object prefix: When OSS sends a request to the origin, the prefix of the object is replaced by the specified prefix.

|2020-05-22|All regions|[Configure back-to-origin rules](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Basic settings/Configure back-to-origin rules.md)|
|Retention of folders uploaded by using drag upload|When a folder is uploaded to OSS by using drag upload in the OSS console, all subfolders in the folder are retained.|2020-05-22|All regions|[Upload objects](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Upload, download, and manage objects/Upload objects.md)|
|Bucket inventory|After the bucket inventory feature is enabled, OSS scans objects in your buckets on a daily or weekly basis, generates an inventory list in the CSV format, and stores the list as an object in a specific bucket. You can specify object metadata to be exported to the inventory list, such as object size and encryption status.|2020-04-30|All regions|[Bucket inventory](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Buckets/Bucket inventory.md)|
|Cold Archive storage|The Cold Archive storage class is added to store cold data that must be stored for an extremely long period of time. Objects of the Cold Archive storage class have a minimum storage size of 64 KB and a minimum storage period of 180 days. Cold Archive storage provides a three-level data retrieval capability and costs less than Archive storage.|2020-04-22|Â |[t4341.md\#section\_gc3\_mvh\_d7b](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Storage classes/Overview.mdsection_gc3_mvh_d7b)|

|Server-side encryption|When you upload data, OSS encrypts the data and stores the encrypted data. When you download data, OSS automatically decrypts the data and returns the original data. The returned HTTP request header declares that the data has been encrypted on the server.|2019-06-18|All regions|[Configure server-side encryption](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Basic settings/Configure server-side encryption.md)|
