# Overdue payments {#concept_lcq_vmh_tdb .concept}

If your account balance is insufficient and you continue to use OSS paid services, you will have an overdue payment.

If you have an overdue payment, note that:

-   Your service is not suspended if you top up your balance within 24 hours.
-   Your OSS is suspended automatically if you fail to pay off all overdue bills within 24 hours. However, you will still be charged for the buckets that are being used. Consequently, the overdue amount will continue to increase.
-   You have 15 days to pay off the overdue bills. The service will be resumed after you pay off the overdue bills.
-   If you fail to pay off all overdue bills within 15 days, you are regarded as voluntarily discarding OSS. Data in your buckets may be deleted and deleted data cannot be recovered. Note that you will still be charged for data stored in OSS before the data is deleted. Therefore, if you no longer want to use OSS, make sure to delete data stored in OSS.
