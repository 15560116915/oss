# Overdue payments {#concept_lcq_vmh_tdb .concept}

This topic describes conditions that lead to an OSS overdue payment and the service status after the payment is overdue.

If your account balance is insufficient and you continue to use OSS paid services, you will have an overdue payment.

If you have an overdue payment, note that:

-   You will not be affected by the service suspension if you top up your balance within 24 hours.
-   Your OSS will be suspended automatically if you fail to pay off all overdue bills within 24 hours. However, you will still be charged for the buckets that are being used. Consequently, the overdue amount will continue to increase.
-   You will have 15 days to pay off the overdue bills. The service will be resumed after you pay off the overdue bills.
-   If you fail to pay off all overdue bills within 15 days, you will be regarded as voluntarily discarding OSS. Data in your buckets may be deleted and deleted data cannot be recovered. Note that you will still be charged for data stored in OSS before the data is deleted. Therefore, if you wish to no longer use OSS, make sure to delete data stored in OSS.
