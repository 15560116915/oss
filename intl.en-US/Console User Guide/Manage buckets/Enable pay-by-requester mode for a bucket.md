You can enable pay-by-requester mode for a bucket. In this mode, requesters are charged for requests and traffic, and the bucket owner is charged only for the storage. Pay-by-requester mode is only available in the China South 1 \(Shenzhen\) region currently and will be supported in more regions.

2.  In the left-side bucket list, click the bucket that you want to enable pay-by-requester mode for. 
3.  In the overview page of the bucket, click the **Basic Settings** tab, and then click **Configure** in the **Pay by Requester** area. 
4.  Enable or disable pay-by-requester mode for the bucket.
