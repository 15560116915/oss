# Host a static website {#concept_ars_bhz_5db .concept}

You can set your bucket to host a static website and access this static website through the bucket domain name.

-   If the default webpage is blank, static website hosting is disabled.
-   If static website hosting is enabled, we recommend that you use CNAME to bind your domain name.
-   If you directly access the static website root domain or any URL ending with “/“ under this domain, the default homepage is returned.

**Note:** When you use an OSS endpoint in Mainland China regions or the China\(Hong Kong\) region to access a web file through the Internet , the Content-Disposition: 'attachment=filename;' is automatically added to the Response Header, and the web file is downloaded as an attachment. If you access OSS with a user domain, the Content-Disposition: 'attachment=filename;' will not be added to the Response Header. For more information about using the user domain to access OSS, see [Bind a custom domain name](../../../../reseller.en-US/Developer Guide/Buckets/Bind a custom domain.md#).
