# Delete an object {#concept_hpp_1mm_vdb .concept}

If you do not need to store uploaded files any longer, delete them to avoid further fees. You can delete a single file or multiple files on the OSS console.

**Note:** 

-   The deleted file cannot be recovered. Perform this operation with caution.
-   You can delete up to **1000** files at a time on the console.
-   If you want to delete only the selected files or perform batch deletion in a larger volume, follow the procedures in API or SDK documents. For more information, see the relevant sections of the [Delete an object](../../../../intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Manage files/Delete an object.md#).
-   API: See [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_21/DNOSS11835551/EN-US\_TP\_4699.md\#](../../../../intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/DeleteObject.md#) and [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_21/DNOSS11835551/EN-US\_TP\_4700.md\#](../../../../intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/DeleteMultipleObjects.md#).
-   SDK: See Delete multiple objects in [Java SDK - Manage objects](../../../../intl.en-US/SDK Reference/Java/Manage objects/Delete objects.md#).
