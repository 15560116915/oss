# Search for objects {#concept_pfs_f4l_vdb .concept}

This section describes how to use the OSS console to search for objects with the same name prefix in a bucket or folder.

When you perform search by name prefix, the search string is case-sensitive and cannot contain the forward slash \(/\). The search range is limited to the root level of the current bucket or the objects in the current folder \(not including subfolders and objects in them\). For more information about how to use the forward slash \(/\) on OSS, see [View the object list](../../../../intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Manage files/View the object list.md#).

## Procedure {#section_qny_g4l_vdb .section}

1.  Log on to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  Click to open the target bucket.
3.  Click **Files**.
4.  Enter the search prefix, such as abc, in the search box, and press Enter or click the **search** icon.

    The system lists the names of the objects and folders prefixed with abc in the root directory of the bucket.

    **Note:** To search in a folder, open the folder and enter a search prefix in the search box. The system lists the names of the objects and folders matching the search prefix in the root directory of the folder.
